### 👉 Description
With the external service (e-government) simulation, a simulation has been made in which gamers can buy games. In this simulation, there may be campaigns in the games. Discounts are made through these campaigns.

Gamer registration is made according to the **Republic of Türkiye Identity Number**. The codes that control the ID number algorithm are contained in the `external` package. External services are used in the system through `adapters`.
